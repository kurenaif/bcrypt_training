WARNING: HTML report generation will become a non-default optional feature in Criterion.rs 0.4.0.
This feature is being moved to cargo-criterion (https://github.com/bheisler/cargo-criterion) and will be optional in a future version of Criterion.rs. To silence this warning, either switch to cargo-criterion or enable the 'html_reports' feature in your Cargo.toml.
